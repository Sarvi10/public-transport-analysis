# public-transport-analysis
   - Data Analysis on Public Transport Passenger Journeys --> Includes Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Visualizations.
   - This project analyzes daily public transport passenger journeys using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.  
   - It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and multiple visualization techniques.

## Project Highlights
- Converted Excel dataset to CSV using Python
- Automatically detected date column and cleaned missing values
- Applied intelligent forward/backward fill strategies
- Created custom feature: **Traffic Index**
- Developed Daily Growth Metrics for each transport service
- Visualized:
  - Multi-line time series trends
  - Growth-rate correlations (heatmap)
  - Traffic Index trend
  - Passenger count distributions
